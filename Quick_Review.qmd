# Quick Review 

Quick Review can be selected from the Quick Review tab at the top of the browser and also can be accessed from a direct link:[ https://review.ebird.org/admin/qr.htm](https://review.ebird.org/admin/qr.htm). Our Quick Review webinar walked through the new tool and explained a bit more about the rationale behind its design and plans for the future. We encourage all reviewers to[ watch this video about Quick Review](https://vod.video.cornell.edu/media/eBird+Quick+Review+webinar_12Nov2019/1_s0barnj8). 

**Advantages of Quick Review**

Quick Review provides the same options for reviewing records as clicking the email icon next to a record in the main queue, with the main difference being that you can skip records without returning to the queue view. **Note that you can always access Quick Review for any record via the link on the Observation page (i.e., History link).** 

**When Not to use Quick Review**

The traditional Review Queue remains the best place to deal with certain other types of issues. The traditional queue can be easily accessed with one click on the date (goes to checklist page for Checklist-level review) or review history link, which goes to History page where other review actions (e.g., the Species-Sensitive Species review reason or any changes in Exotics Mode) can be made. These scenarios are best dealt with in the traditional Review pages: 

-   Records without documentation (which do not appear in Quick Review at all)  

<!-- -->

-   Checklist-level review  

<!-- -->

-   Multiple similar records at once (e.g., hundreds of independent records of a known rarity)  

<!-- -->

-   Review of records as a Sensitive Species (using Species-Sensitive Species reason) or Exotic species changes in Exotics Mode.

<!-- -->

-   Records that you wish to keep in the queue indefinitely using the reason Species-Rereview Requested (this reason is not available through Quick Review)  

<!-- -->

-   When you wish to filter or sort records by specific attributes
