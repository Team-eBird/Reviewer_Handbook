{"title":"What records appear in the Review Queue?","markdown":{"headingText":"What records appear in the Review Queue?","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nRecords are “flagged” for the Review Queue primarily through an automated process involving expert-created filters (see [Part II](Your_Filter_Assignment.qmd) for more on filters). These filters set expected counts by date for each species in each region. Records are flagged by filters for the following reasons:  \n\n-   **Rarity:** a species that is rare or unusual in the region; these species are set to a limit of zero year-round on filters. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **Out-of-season report:** a species reported outside its normal date range in a region; these filters are set to zero for that species only within a certain date range. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **High count:** a species count that exceeds a non-zero filter value, which represents the maximum number one might expect to find in the region on a particular date.  \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **Not on checklist:** meaning the species is not included on your filter at all. Examples include a first state record, a record new to the region, novel Escapee exotics, newly-recorded hybrids, or even regular subspecies or spuhs (e.g., scoter sp.) that are not shown on the current checklist. If the bird is expected and deserves to be on the list of species, please be sure to [add it to the filter](Filter_Basics.qmd#editing-a-filter)! Note that [we don’t recommend](Non-species_Taxa_on_eBird_Filters.qmd) including all subspecies options, but distinctive and well-known ones should be included, especially when two or more occur in a region. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **Post-submission edits:** certain edits made by users (e.g., change of species, change of date of observations, change of location, or increase in the count) will trigger a re-check of the filter and that may result in the record being flagged after initial submission. In addition, the process of a checklist being marked Not Public and then Public again means it will be treated as a new submission. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **Records for Rereview**: There are several additional ways that a record can appear in the Review Queue, including records flagged by Media Reviewers as potential photo errors or records set to Rereview by a reviewer. They all appear with Status of Rereview, highlighted in orange. Be sure to always read the History for any record set to Rereview. Please see [Rereview Status](Review_Decision_Status_and_Reason.qmd#review-status) below for more on these. \n\n**How often are flagged records added to the Review Queue?**\n\nRecords are harvested by the “Review Robot” once every 15 minutes for the Review Queue. Any newly-submitted or recently-edited record that is not already in the Review Queue, and exceeds a filter, will be added at this time.  \n\n**Why was this unexceptional record flagged for review?**\n\nIf a record is harvested for the Review Queue because of a high count and the eBirder later reduces the count to a value that is not flagged by the filter, this **does not** remove the record from the Review Queue. This can sometimes make it seem as if the record was flagged erroneously. The last edited date on the [Submission Page](The_eBird_Checklist_Page.qmd) may be helpful, since it could show an edit since the record was flagged, but **note that reviewers sending emails are also logged as changes here**. These records are usually easy decisions and can be accepted using a Review Reason of Record-Not exceptional (See [Appendix A](Review_Reasons.qmd)). Note that running your filters will remove these records from the queue. See [Part II](Your_Filter_Assignment.qmd), eBird
