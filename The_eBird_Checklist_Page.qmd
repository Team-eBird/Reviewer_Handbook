# The eBird Checklist Page 

Each eBird observation is part of an eBird checklist, also known as an eBird Submission or “sub.” Viewing the entire checklist also may give you information to assess the experience of the person reporting the record. If the checklist contains a number of questionable records, you may be more inclined to Unconfirm flagged observations without further investigation. **Verifying the overall acceptability of a checklist should be the first step in your review process.**  

Each checklist is defined by a unique Submission ID (e.g., S45355741) which is also part of the URL for the checklist page in eBird (e.g.,<https://ebird.org/checklist/S45355741>). Try clicking the Submission ID from the Review Queue, which will take you to a Submission page like this:

**Additional notes about the Checklist Page**

Importantly, **Last Edited Date** is only visible on this page and applies to the entire checklist. Changes that update the Last Edited Date include edits to the date, location, comments, or any species count, and could also include any decision by a reviewer, or even a programmatic change like a hotspot merge or a taxonomy update. However, this page does not give any  detail on the exact nature of any change.

The metadata (effort metrics such as start time, duration, distance, etc.) displayed on the Checklist Page will vary depending on the protocol used and other specifics. Some effort metrics, such as automatic Mobile information tags from eBird mobile, are only visible on the public checklist page. Other metadata, like the GPS track associated with a traveling checklist from eBird Mobile, are visible only to the checklist owner(s).  

**Public/Not Public:** In almost all cases, reviewers can change a checklist from Not Public to Public or vice versa. See the next section; see also our page about [The eBird Data Quality and Review Process](https://support.ebird.org/support/solutions/articles/48000795278). 

**You can also review observations on the Checklist Page** by selecting the checkboxes next to the species that require action and then proceed as detailed in [Reviewing Observations](How_to_Review_Observations.qmd#reviewing-observations-from-the-review-queue) above.  

## Checklist-level Review 

The first question you ask during eBird review should be whether there are problems that apply to the entire checklist. There is no need to spend time reviewing individual records if there is a problem with the entire checklist, such as: 

-   The checklist is a “list building” or “life list” entry (i.e., multiple locations and dates in a single list)   

<!-- -->

-   Excessive distance (typically greater than 15 miles or 25 km)  

<!-- -->

-   Location or date appear incorrect or the list represents multiple days

<!-- -->

-   The wrong protocol is used 

<!-- -->

-   Checklist is a duplicate 

<!-- -->

-   Checklist is a combination of multiple parties’ lists 

When problems apply to the entire checklist, mark the checklist Not Public in the upper green box on the Checklist Page. A reason is also required, as it helps other reviewers to understand the rationale for treating this checklist as Not Public. Adding Notes is recommended. The Checklist-level review reasons are listed and explained fully in [Appendix A](Review_Reasons.qmd).  

Before marking a checklist Not Public, please do consider whether it has rich media and their potential value; marking a checklist Not Public means that all its photos, audio recordings, and videos will be inaccessible and also marked Unconfirmed. Photographs, audio recordings, and video add important vouchered records and are used in a suite of additional ways in the eBird/Macaulay Library ecosystem (including Illustrated Checklists, Photo ID/Sound ID research, display in species accounts, and more) and these are important to preserve whenever possible. We ask that reviewers please consider taking the extra effort to correspond with eBird users to ensure that well-vouchered checklists are preserved whenever possible. 

There are at least two other common issues that are problematic; please email users to educate them and ask them to fix these. However, we don’t recommend marking checklists Not Public  for these reasons alone. We hope to develop more refined solutions for these issues in the future, and the first is already amply dealt with in eBird’s Status and Trends analyses. 

-   Checklist is marked complete, but seems very unlikely to be so (only includes a rarity or two, etc.) 

<!-- -->

-   The count for all species is ‘1’ but should be ‘X’ 

**How are Not Public checklists hidden from eBird output?**

When you mark a list as Not Public, none of the observations on the checklist will appear in public eBird output, in Review Tools search output (unless you specify that you wish to include Not Public lists in your search), or in scientific output. The checklist view in eBird will always show a message explaining why the checklist is Not Public. 

**Can I review records on Not Public checklists?**

Even though individual records may be correct on a given list, these cannot be reviewed until the checklist is treated as Public. This is because the review process is hierarchical: without correct checklist-level information, the individual observations are also not appropriate for public display in eBird. If a checklist has accurate information and is treated as Public, its records can be reviewed. It may sometimes be necessary to assist observers with correcting the checklist so that an important rarity record can be displayed publicly. 

**How do I contact an observer regarding checklist issues?**

If you wish to email the observer: click the observer's name, copy the email, and send them a note. It is helpful to include the checklist link. There are currently no templates for checklist-level issues; in the future, we hope to add a simpler way to contact observers about checklist-level issues. 

**What happens when checklists are changed from Not Public to Public?**

Most checklists that are marked Not Public can also be changed to Public by you. No reason is required for this. Once the checklist is made Public, it is treated as a new submission: any records that are flagged appear in your review queue as Unconfirmed and Unreviewed while those that are not flagged appear in public output as Accepted and Unreviewed**. This is true even when a flagged observation received a final review decision prior to checklist review.** Obs History on the Observation Page keeps a list of these earlier reviews, which may be helpful for reviewing them a second time.  

**A note regarding Checklist-level Review before 2018**  \
Prior to the August 2018 release of checklist-level review, reviewers would select all observations on a problematic checklist and mark them Unconfirmed using a Checklist-specific review reason. Starting in June 2018, those review reasons were separated out in a distinct Checklist-level review process. We then revisited all previously reviewed records. Any Unconfirmed observations with a Checklist-specific review reason had that decision and reason applied to the entire checklist; these dates will be between June-August 2018. 

It is possible that some checklists were erroneously marked Not Public during this transition because a single record was inadvertently given a checklist-level reason instead of an observation-level reason. When these are identified, we recommend marking the checklist Public and then reviewing individual observations as needed. 

## Automatic Checklist-level Reviews 

There are several situations that result in actions being taken on checklists that bypass your Review Queue.  

-   **Country, State, or County-level Checklists:** these occur if the observer chooses “Select an entire city, county, or state” on the data entry page. County-level or broader locations should only be used if the observer lacks more precise location information, since these observations can’t accurately be displayed on a map. These records are automatically marked Not Public with a reason of Unconfirmed, Location-Country Level, Unconfirmed, Location-State Level, or Unconfirmed, Location-County Level. 

<!-- -->

-   **Date of 1 Jan 1900:** eBird allows observers to [build life lists](https://support.ebird.org/support/solutions/articles/48000804866), country lists etc. by submitting incidental checklists with no start time for 1 Jan 1900. Submissions from this exact date are automatically treated as Not Public with the reason Checklist-List Building. In the rare event that a legitimate historical entry comes from 1 Jan 1900, reviewers can override this designation. Note also that reviewers should mark list building efforts from other dates in the same way, but this is a manual, not automated, process (see [Checklist-level Review Reasons](Checklist-level_Review_Reasons.qmd). 

<!-- -->

-   **Distance Too Long:** eBird automatically marks some checklists Not Public with a reason Checklist-Distance Too Long when 1) a High Seas (Region Code = XX) checklist exceeds 100 miles (160.93 km) in distance; or 2) any non-High Seas checklist exceeds 50 miles (80.47 km). Note that when the observer changes the mileage, this does not trigger any change in the status of the checklist—only a reviewer can reverse a checklist that was marked Not Public with the Checklist-Distance Too Long reason. This is because we want reviewers to check the logic of observers here and to ensure they are not dishonestly reducing mileage. 

<!-- -->

-   **User-hidden Checklists:** if an observer hides a checklist under Checklist Tools, it will mark the entire checklist Not Public and remove it from all forms of eBird output (the submission might be visible on the Top 100, but it will have no location associated with it). If the observer later unhides the record, any flagged records will need review. 

<!-- -->

-   **Blocklisted Users:** some observers violate eBird terms of use or otherwise do not comply with the [eBird Code of Conduct](https://support.ebird.org/support/solutions/articles/48000795278). If observers are placed on the eBird blocklist (see [eBird Blocklist](eBird_Blocklist.qmd) below) all submissions appear as Observer-Suppressed. These blocklisted observers are still able to share checklists, but should not do so, since this review reason will carry over to observations from the non-blocklisted observer. This is not the responsibility of the reviewer to correct, but this should be explained to the users involved if checklists are being shared from a blocklisted account.
