# Other Reviewing Options 

## Reviewing from an eBird Checklist 

When you’re logged in to eBird, **you can review any eBird checklist in your assignment region.** Here’s an example of a public checklist (<https://ebird.org/checklist/S45355741>):

![](images/paste-16.png){fig-align="center"}

As shown above, review options on public eBird checklists appear as flag icons. Clicking the flag next to the observation will open Quick Review; click History if you prefer to see that page or to use the default email. If you don’t see the icons, you are not logged in, are looking at a checklist from outside your review assignment area, or you do not have review privileges properly enabled. 

**Note:** eBird checklists will include ALL species reported by the observer, including those already deemed Unconfirmed. When you are logged in as a reviewer, for checklists in your review region, [Sensitive Species](Sensitive_Species.qmd) will also be visible only to you and the checklist owner(s) and will be clearly marked; Sensitive Species will not be visible to the general public.  

## Review Media 

As an eBird reviewer, one of your major roles is to ensure all photos are correctly identified. Even if an Observation is otherwise correct, a single misidentified photo in an Observation means that Observation should be treated as Unconfirmed (until it is corrected). It may be helpful to add a reviewer for your region to focus solely on media issues. In November 2015 we added the ability to drag-and-drop photos and audio recordings directly in eBird checklists via the Macaulay Library. This process automatically assigns the photo metadata including the species of the bird, count, date, location, and more, and archives the photo as a digital specimen akin to a museum specimen. You may find misidentified photos when browsing records in your region, but your Review Queue will also include misidentified photos found by others.  

**Who are “Media Reviewers”?**

Media reviewers include all regional editors and all eBirders that have submitted 100 or more complete checklists in the previous year. Media Reviewers have the ability to[ flag incorrect media](https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000795278-the-ebird-review-process#anchorFlaggedMedia), as described below. Regional Editors are enabled with global Media Review permissions. Media Reviewers who are not also regional editors do NOT have other review privileges. They cannot access the Review Queue, see review History, review individual records on public checklists, etc.  

**How does Media Review work?**

If a Media Reviewer finds a misidentified photo, sound, or video while[ browsing eBird](https://ebird.org/media/catalog), clicking on that photo will give them the option to “Report” it with additional details. It is helpful to refer to specific media asset from the checklist (possibly including the Macaulay Library link). The Offensive or inappropriate content option is intended only for vulgar, rude, or otherwise inappropriate content, not misidentifications or photos of non-birds. 

![When media are flagged, the record appears with the status Rereview and reason Species-Media ID Questioned. Remember that records could have been flagged for Rereview for another reason. Always check the History on such records to see why it was flagged and make sure to check the Media reviewer’s comments. ](images/paste-17.png)

**How should I review incorrectly identified photos?**

If any photo is not correct, the observer should be contacted and asked to fix it. Using the reason Unconfirm, Species-Misidentified provides an email format that gives all the relevant information on Change Species and is by far the best and most efficient way to email observers about these types of issues. It is always nice to include some relevant field marks or resources when you contact the observer and to try to refer to the specific photo(s) that need fixing. Please also steer them to the[ Change Species article](https://support.ebird.org/support/solutions/articles/48000625567#anchorChangeSpecies) to correct the media.  

Be aware that when photos are reidentified and moved between species, often the observers need to change the count as well. For example, if two Laughing Gulls were reported, but one image showed a Franklin’s Gull, then the Laughing Gull count should probably be reduced to one. Remember also that when observers use Change Species to move media, the status will change to Rereview, ensuring that you will see the record again so you can check that the correct changes were made. However, if the observer deletes photos, they will have to contact you in order for the record to be Rereviewed. 

**Why do some media not have a Report flag?**

Any piece of media that appears on an eBird checklist, and has a Macaulay Library link, has been uploaded via the normal eBird upload process. However, please note that it remains possible to have “embedded” media that displays media from other websites (e.g., Flickr, Facebook, Picasa, iNaturalist) in eBird checklists and these do not have the Report button. While these can be useful for verification of a record, we do not consider this a best practice for eBird, since these links can be easily lost or broken through changes by the third-party website. Please encourage users to upload directly to eBird whenever possible, but please do accept such records when the photo confirms the identification. Also, please note that when using Media Search tools, including Illustrated Checklist galleries, some media (especially audio and video) will be delivered from the master Macaulay Library archive and these are not (yet) associated with eBird checklists. To report an error on these, email Jay McGowan (jwm57\@cornell.edu). 

## Change Species 

[Change Species](https://support.ebird.org/support/solutions/articles/48000625567#anchorChangeSpecies) makes it easy for observers to revise an entire record, with all associated metadata and media, to a new species. When an eBirder uses Change Species for an entire observation, any previous review decisions are preserved in History, but the record is rerun through the filters as though for the first time. Thus, if a record considered Unconfirmed is revised using Change Species and the new taxon it is changed to is not flagged, then it will be treated as Accepted and Unreviewed since it will not have been flagged by the filter.  

**How are species changes indicated in review history?**

A reason of Species-Identification Changed will also appear in History along with an entry in Reviewer Notes that says something like “Taxon changed from semsan to litsti”. The alphanumeric codes after “from” and “to” refer to the previous and current taxon of the record, respectively. The common names corresponding to these codes can be found by[ downloading the eBird taxonomy](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/download/) or by pasting the species code to the end of a species page (e.g., for “litsi” enter[ https://ebird.org/species/litsti](https://ebird.org/species/litsti)). In this example, the taxon was changed from Semipalmated Sandpiper (“semsan”, Calidris pusilla) to Little Stint (“litsti”, Calidris minuta). 

We use the eBird code in this case because 1) they are more constant, regardless of changes in taxonomy or nomenclature; 2) they do not require translation to the Reviewer's language preference, which would not be possible here.  

**Will species changes always cause a record to resurface for review?**

Sometimes an observer needs to delete a photo or use Change Species to move a single photo to the correct species. For records that are Unconfirmed, using Change Species to move media to or from a given species will trigger either record for Rereview if the observation had been marked Unconfirmed. Thus, moving a photo from American Coot to American Wigeon will not trigger Rereview if neither record has been marked Unconfirmed. But if the reviewer marked the coot Unconfirmed, because it had a photo showing a wigeon, the American Coot record will be flagged for rereview once the media are moved so the reviewer can check this. Note that deleting a single piece of media **will not** change the overall record’s review status and will not cause it to resurface in the queue, so observers must notify the reviewer once such actions have been taken; see also the note at the end of the above [Rereview Status](Review_Decision_Status_and_Reason.qmd#rereview) section. See also the section below, since eBird Central changes during taxonomic updates will not trigger rereview.

**Species changes from taxonomic updates by eBird Central**

eBird updates its taxonomy once annually to align with the most modern science on species limits and nomenclature in birds. When these updates happen, staff at eBird Central adjust observations to align with the new taxonomy whenever it is safe to do so (i.e., when the location or date of an observation could only pertain to one species). These updates use a special tool at eBird Central and starting in 2024 these updates have treated records in two special ways:

1.  We assume that eBird Central is making changes that reviewers would approve of and that the change to a new taxon is the correct one. For example, when Herring Gull was split, all reports of Herring Gull Larus argentatus from Panama that lacked subspecies designation were presumed to pertain to American Herring Gull Larus smithsonianus (if the observer had specified the subspecies, that identification would have been retained after the split, of course). Since Herring Gull is a rarity there, all records had already been reviewed and approved by a reviewer. Even though eBird Central moved the records from Larus argentatus (sensu lato) to Larus smithsonianus, which is a more refined identification, we also retain the previous review outcome. Thus, if the record was Reviewed and Accepted, we retain that and if the record had been treated as Unconfirmed with reason Documentation-Inadequate, we also retain that.

2.  Whenever these changes occur, a row is entered in History that describes the taxonomic change and also includes text like this: “Taxon changed from hergul to amhgul1 \[taxonomic update from eBird Central; previous review outcome retained\]”
