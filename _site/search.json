    "text": "Using eBird’s Explore Data Tools to Find Records for Review \neBird’s Explore pages provide rich resources to identify interesting outlier records. The Review Tools have limitations. For instance, it is not easy to find all inland records of Common Eiders in New England, USA, for large counties that touch the coast. This can be easily addressed using eBird Range Maps, which are another entry point for review. \nPoint Maps: UsingSpecies Maps to map individual observations can identify geographical outliers, or records that seem out of place. For example, coastal birds plotted inland or terrestrial species plotted offshore. There are also similar-looking species that overlap in their distributions, providing challenges to the casual observer but not flagged by filters. For example, where ranges overlap for Black-capped and Carolina chickadees in the eastern US, reviewers might have to look at records on the Species Maps to ensure that no points are way out of each species’ typical range. Species Maps may be the only efficient way to correct such errors, since the regional filters may not be able to catch them. Click on points in the Species Map to obtain the checklist link and review directly from there. To find reports outside of the expected date range, use the Date drop-down in the menu bar to limit which points are shown.  \nBird lists for regions, hotspots, and . For example:https://ebird.org/region/USFWS_14/bird-list. These display when a species was first seen, most recently seen, and its high count for either the current year or all years (default). To review the records just click the date from this page (or almost anywhere in eBird) to get the checklist review page. \nRare Bird Alerts for your review region will send email notifications (hourly or daily) with checklist links that you can use for review. Since these reports are being watched by others, quick review is always welcome. This is a very useful way to keep up with incoming records and to be promptly notified of rarities submitted.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Each eBird observation is part of an eBird checklist, also known as an eBird Submission or “sub.” Viewing the entire checklist also may give you information to assess the experience of the person reporting the record. If the checklist contains a number of questionable records, you may be more inclined to Unconfirm flagged observations without further investigation. Verifying the overall acceptability of a checklist should be the first step in your review process.  \nEach checklist is defined by a unique Submission ID (e.g., S45355741) which is also part of the URL for the checklist page in eBird (e.g.,https://ebird.org/checklist/S45355741). Try clicking the Submission ID from the Review Queue, which will take you to a Submission page like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional notes about the Checklist Page\nImportantly, Last Edited Date is only visible on this page and applies to the entire checklist. Changes that update the Last Edited Date include edits to the date, location, comments, or any species count, and could also include any decision by a reviewer, or even a programmatic change like a hotspot merge or a taxonomy update. However, this page does not give any  detail on the exact nature of any change.\nThe metadata (effort metrics such as start time, duration, distance, etc.) displayed on the Checklist Page will vary depending on the protocol used and other specifics. Some effort metrics, such as automatic Mobile information tags from eBird mobile, are only visible on the public checklist page. Other metadata, like the GPS track associated with a traveling checklist from eBird Mobile, are visible only to the checklist owner(s).  \nPublic/Not Public: In almost all cases, reviewers can change a checklist from Not Public to Public or vice versa. See the next section; see also our page aboutThe eBird Data Quality and Review Process. \nYou can also review observations on the Checklist Page by selecting the checkboxes next to the species that require action and then proceed as detailed in Reviewing Observations above.  \n\n\nThe first question you ask during eBird review should be whether there are problems that apply to the entire checklist. There is no need to spend time reviewing individual records if there is a problem with the entire checklist, such as: \n\nThe checklist is a “list building” or “life list” entry (i.e., multiple locations and dates in a single list)   \n\n\n\nExcessive distance (typically greater than 15 miles or 25 km)  \n\n\n\nLocation or date appear incorrect or the list represents multiple days\n\n\n\nThe wrong protocol is used \n\n\n\nChecklist is a duplicate \n\n\n\nChecklist is a combination of multiple parties’ lists \n\nWhen problems apply to the entire checklist, mark the checklist Not Public in the upper green box on the Checklist Page. A reason is also required, as it helps other reviewers to understand the rationale for treating this checklist as Not Public. Adding Notes is recommended. The Checklist-level review reasons are listed and explained fully in Appendix A.  \nBefore marking a checklist Not Public, please do consider whether it has rich media and their potential value; marking a checklist Not Public means that all its photos, audio recordings, and videos will be inaccessible and also marked Unconfirmed. Photographs, audio recordings, and video add important vouchered records and are used in a suite of additional ways in the eBird/Macaulay Library ecosystem (including Illustrated Checklists, Photo ID/Sound ID research, display in species accounts, and more) and these are important to preserve whenever possible. We ask that reviewers please consider taking the extra effort to correspond with eBird users to ensure that well-vouchered checklists are preserved whenever possible. \nThere are at least two other common issues that are problematic; please email users to educate them and ask them to fix these. However, we don’t recommend marking checklists Not Public  for these reasons alone. We hope to develop more refined solutions for these issues in the future, and the first is already amply dealt with in eBird’s Status and Trends analyses. \n\nChecklist is marked complete, but seems very unlikely to be so (only includes a rarity or two, etc.) \n\n\n\nThe count for all species is ‘1’ but should be ‘X’ \n\nHow are Not Public checklists hidden from eBird output?\nWhen you mark a list as Not Public, none of the observations on the checklist will appear in public eBird output, in Review Tools search output (unless you specify that you wish to include Not Public lists in your search), or in scientific output. The checklist view in eBird will always show a message explaining why the checklist is Not Public. \nCan I review records on Not Public checklists?\nEven though individual records may be correct on a given list, these cannot be reviewed until the checklist is treated as Public. This is because the review process is hierarchical: without correct checklist-level information, the individual observations are also not appropriate for public display in eBird. If a checklist has accurate information and is treated as Public, its records can be reviewed. It may sometimes be necessary to assist observers with correcting the checklist so that an important rarity record can be displayed publicly. \nHow do I contact an observer regarding checklist issues?\nIf you wish to email the observer: click the observer’s name, copy the email, and send them a note. It is helpful to include the checklist link. There are currently no templates for checklist-level issues; in the future, we hope to add a simpler way to contact observers about checklist-level issues. \nWhat happens when checklists are changed from Not Public to Public?\nMost checklists that are marked Not Public can also be changed to Public by you. No reason is required for this. Once the checklist is made Public, it is treated as a new submission: any records that are flagged appear in your review queue as Unconfirmed and Unreviewed while those that are not flagged appear in public output as Accepted and Unreviewed. This is true even when a flagged observation received a final review decision prior to checklist review. Obs History on the Observation Page keeps a list of these earlier reviews, which may be helpful for reviewing them a second time.  \nA note regarding Checklist-level Review before 2018  \nPrior to the August 2018 release of checklist-level review, reviewers would select all observations on a problematic checklist and mark them Unconfirmed using a Checklist-specific review reason. Starting in June 2018, those review reasons were separated out in a distinct Checklist-level review process. We then revisited all previously reviewed records. Any Unconfirmed observations with a Checklist-specific review reason had that decision and reason applied to the entire checklist; these dates will be between June-August 2018. \nIt is possible that some checklists were erroneously marked Not Public during this transition because a single record was inadvertently given a checklist-level reason instead of an observation-level reason. When these are identified, we recommend marking the checklist Public and then reviewing individual observations as needed. \n\n\n\nThere are several situations that result in actions being taken on checklists that bypass your Review Queue.  \n\nCountry, State, or County-level Checklists: these occur if the observer chooses “Select an entire city, county, or state” on the data entry page. County-level or broader locations should only be used if the observer lacks more precise location information, since these observations can’t accurately be displayed on a map. These records are automatically marked Not Public with a reason of Unconfirmed, Location-Country Level, Unconfirmed, Location-State Level, or Unconfirmed, Location-County Level. \n\n\n\nDate of 1 Jan 1900: eBird allows observers tobuild life lists, country lists etc. by submitting incidental checklists with no start time for 1 Jan 1900. Submissions from this exact date are automatically treated as Not Public with the reason Checklist-List Building. In the rare event that a legitimate historical entry comes from 1 Jan 1900, reviewers can override this designation. Note also that reviewers should mark list building efforts from other dates in the same way, but this is a manual, not automated, process (see Checklist-level Review Reasons below). \n\n\n\nDistance Too Long: eBird automatically marks some checklists Not Public with a reason Checklist-Distance Too Long when 1) a High Seas (Region Code = XX) checklist exceeds 100 miles (160.93 km) in distance; or 2) any non-High Seas checklist exceeds 50 miles (80.47 km). Note that when the observer changes the mileage, this does not trigger any change in the status of the checklist—only a reviewer can reverse a checklist that was marked Not Public with the Checklist-Distance Too Long reason. This is because we want reviewers to check the logic of observers here and to ensure they are not dishonestly reducing mileage. \n\n\n\nUser-hidden Checklists: if an observer hides a checklist under Checklist Tools, it will mark the entire checklist Not Public and remove it from all forms of eBird output (the submission might be visible on the Top 100, but it will have no location associated with it). If the observer later unhides the record, any flagged records will need review. \n\n\n\nBlocklisted Users: some observers violate eBird terms of use or otherwise do not comply with theeBird Code of Conduct. If observers are placed on the eBird blocklist (see eBird Blocklist below) all submissions appear as Observer-Suppressed. These blocklisted observers are still able to share checklists, but should not do so, since this review reason will carry over to observations from the non-blocklisted observer. This is not the responsibility of the reviewer to correct, but this should be explained to the users involved if checklists are being shared from a blocklisted account.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Reviewing consists of assigning a Decision, Status, and Reason to each record in your queue. Therefore, before you can commence the review process, it is critical to understand what these different designations mean.  \n\n\nReview Decision can be either Unconfirmed or Accepted and governs whether a record is displayed publicly on eBird. Only Accepted records appear in eBird science products (e.g., eBird Basic Dataset, Status & Trends) and eBird output (maps, graphs, etc.). Unconfirmed records are not shown in public eBird output or science products with two exceptions: Alerts and Media searches (or galleries) may show and clearly indicate Unconfirmed records that are also Unreviewed (see Review Status, below); Alerts only show those submitted in the past 7 days and Media searches show those only when clearly specified by the user.  \nReview Decision has no bearing on personal data displays for observers (e.g., Life Lists, other list totals, profile maps, Top100 totals). Much like someone’s original field notes, both Accepted and Unconfirmed species are displayed in full, without indication of Review Decision, on an eBirder’s personal checklists. (Note: we use the terms Accepted and Unconfirmed, as opposed to Valid and Not Valid, since they more directly express the decision by the reviewer and are less pejorative.)\n\n\n\nThe review reason is a short explanation for your review decision. Please make sure you fully understand the Review Reasons in Appendix A. The drop-down lists show review reasons specific to Accepted or Unconfirmed decisions. In order to Accept or Unconfirm a record you must provide a reason. This is very important, since your decisions may be reconsidered later if there is no reason to defend why a certain action was taken. Review Reason is always selected by the reviewer except when Deferred records exceed their time limit (see Deferred status below) when this process is partly automated. (Note however that older review decisions will not always have review reasons.) \n\n\n\nReview Status is a designation set by automated processes or by reviewers. A record’s Review Status can be: \n\n\nThis Review Status can be associated with either Accepted or Unconfirmed records and indicates that a record has been reviewed.\n\n\n\nThis Review Status can be associated with either Accepted or Unconfirmed records and indicates that a record has not been reviewed.\n\n\n\nAnytime you find a record set to Rereview you should click the History to understand why. The Rereview Status always appears in orange and can indicate any of the following:\n\n\n\nMedia added to Unconfirmed record: Any record marked Unconfirmed that then has media added will resurface for Rereview. This gives the reviewer a chance to decide if the record was actually correct.  \nMedia moved to or from Unconfirmed records: Any record with misidentified media should be marked Unconfirmed after notifying the user. Transferring media to or from a record using Change Species also triggers any flagged record to be set to Unconfirmed, Rereview. For example, if a Parasitic Jaeger record has a count of two individuals, two photos of Parasitic and one photo of Long-tailed, the observer should be notified to move their misidentified photo to the correct species. Supposing the Long-tailed Jaeger had also been marked Unconfirmed (perhaps for lack of documentation!), transferring the photo to Long-tailed Jaeger would ensure that a reviewer would review it again and we would also want a reviewer to check that the Parasitic Jaeger photos and count are now correct (probably the observer should tally one Parasitic Jaeger now). If Change Species is not used, there is no automated way to re-flag these records; please rereview if found though!\nMedia Review: Media reviewers and reviewers with permissions in your area can flag misidentified media, which puts it in Rereview. See Review Media and Media-ID Questioned under Review Reasons with Unconfirm for more information.\nNotes added to certain records: Any record with a reason of Documentation Inadequate (including Documentation Inadequate-Species, Documentation Inadequate-Count, or Merlin ID-Documentation Inadequate) will resurface for review if documentation is edited or added, including adding media or editing comments. This applies to records with a status of Deferred or Unconfirmed. \nRecord manually set to rereview by another reviewer: Other reviewers with permissions in your area, including a small number with global permissions, can manually set records to Rereview. See Species-Rereview Requested under Other Review Reasons for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the History link in the Review Queue to learn who has flagged the record for Rereview; click the name to contact that reviewer if you need information regarding the Status change.  \n\n\n\nThis status is to be used only in special circumstances. Deferred indicates a reviewer has sent the observer a request for more information and is pending reply, but also wants to keep the record visible on alerts.   \nWhat happens to records when they are Deferred? Deferred records remain in the Review Queue for 14 days and also appear on eBird Alerts if the observation date is within the past 7 days (the period of eBird Alerts). Once the 14-day period has elapsed, the Deferred record will be marked Unconfirmed and Reviewed if it is a record that exceeds the filter limit. If at any time the observer adds media, or if records tagged as Documentation Inadequate have edits to Species Details, the record will appear in the queue with a status of Rereview and will remain visible until a reviewer makes a final decision.\nImportantly, if the record does not exceed the filter limits, it will return to a status of Accepted and Unreviewed when the Defer period expires or when a filter is rerun. These records that are allowed by the filter remain that way until a reviewer makes a final decision on the record (including Rereview). Therefore, we strongly recommend reviewing unflagged records as Unconfirmed instead of Deferred. Note that if you want to keep such a record visible in Needs Alerts, using the review reason Species-Rereview Requested will do this and will not have an automatic change of status later. \nWhen to use Defer: We recommend using Defer for recent records that may be correct, but where more information is needed. The main reason to Defer a record is to retain its visibility in Alerts.  \nIt is very important that reviewers use Defer correctly: if the record can be resolved immediately using Unconfirmed, we recommend that you do so. If the record can be assigned a tentative final decision, we also recommend implementing this immediately. Remember that Unconfirmed record will return to the Review Queue if the eBirder adds media (or uses Change Species to adjust media). For records Reviewed or Deferred with reason Documentation-Inadequate, the record will return to the Review Queue if the eBirder adds or edits their Species Details. These will appear as Species-Rereview Requested and a History line will be added to explain what happened. If the observer just replies to your email, you should have the checklist link accessible in the email to check on the decision also. Records from past years almost never should be Deferred, and it is better to make a tentative decision immediately with the understanding that addition of more documentation will also give an opportunity to reassess. \nDeferred records will not appear in Quick Review but do appear in the Review Queue. Any Deferred record in the Review Queue can be set to a final status of Unconfirmed or Accepted at any point. \nHow do I keep Deferred records for more than 14 days? Any record, including Deferred records, can be kept in your queue for longer than 14 days by setting the decision to Unconfirm using the reason Species-Rereview Requested. This will change the status to Rereview and keep the record in the Review Queue indefinitely. Note that there is usually no reason to do this, as Unconfirmed records will reappear in the queue when media or notes are added by the observer. \nHow are Deferred records are displayed in eBird? Deferred records do not appear in public eBird data (maps, graphs, etc.) but will continue to appear with the Unconfirmed tag on eBird Alerts (if within the 7-day window of the Alerts). This can be useful so that area birders are alerted to a possible rarity and can assist in providing documentation. \nHow are Deferred records displayed in Review Tools? When a record is set to Deferred each action is recorded in the record’s History on the observation page. Using the Defer option from Quick Review will set two records at the same time: one for the default email being sent and one for the preliminary decision. In the below example, once the 14-day window expires, another History line will be added that sets the record to Unconfirmed with the reason Documentation Inadequate-Species.",

Transferring media to or from a record using Change Species also triggers any flagged record to be set to Unconfirmed, Rereview.

We encourage all reviewers towatch this video about Quick Review. \nAdvantages of Quick Review\nQuick Review provides the same options for reviewing records as clicking the email icon next to a record in the main queue, with the main difference being that you can skip records without returning to the queue view. Note that you can always access Quick Review for any record via the link on the Observation page (i.e., History link). \nWhen Not to use Quick Review\nThe traditional Review Queue remains the best place to deal with certain other types of issues. The traditional queue can be easily accessed with one click on the date (goes to checklist page for Checklist-level review) or review history link, which goes to History page where other review actions (e.g., the Species-Sensitive Species review reason or any changes in Exotics Mode) can be made. These scenarios are best dealt with in the traditional Review pages: \n\nRecords without documentation (which do not appear in Quick Review at all)  \n\n\n\nChecklist-level review  \n\n\n\nMultiple similar records at once (e.g., hundreds of independent records of a known rarity)  \n\n\n\nReview of records as a Sensitive Species (using Species-Sensitive Species reason) or Exotic species changes in Exotics Mode.\n\n\n\nRecords that you wish to keep in the queue indefinitely using the reason Species-Rereview Requested (this reason is not available through Quick Review)  \n\n\n\nWhen you wish to filter or sort records by specific attributes",

See the section What records appear in the Review Queue? to understand what records appear here and how.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, records on your review list are sorted by observation date, with the most recent records first. You can change the sort order by clicking a column heading, such as Location or User. Most sort options are self-explanatory, but a few require extra explanation:  \n\nSpecies: You can order species taxonomically (Tax) or by category (Cat). Sorting by category (Cat) clusters by taxonomic category (species, subspecies group, spuh, slash, hybrid, intergrade, form, domestic) and then sorts taxonomically within each cluster. This can be a useful way to quickly process subspecies, slashes, and spuhs, which often are valid submissions but may not be regular options on the filter.  \n\n\n\nStatus: You might also wish to sort based on Status. This is especially useful to look for records that are Deferred or Rereview, since these require special consideration. See Review Decision, Status, and Reason for more on Status.  \n\n\n\nSubmission: Clicking Submission sorts by the checklist submission identifier, which clusters all observations within a single checklist together.

    "text": "Important Terms to Know \nThe following terms appear throughout the Review Tools and this handbook. If you are reading this for the first time, please familiarize yourself with the following definitions (commonly occurring synonyms are provided in parentheses). \nSpecies (Taxon): a unique taxon from theeBird taxonomy including species as well as slashes, spuhs, subspecies groups, domestics, intergrades, forms, and hybrids. Species and taxon are used more or less interchangeably in this document. Although referring to taxon is technically correct, we often use the term species for examples below, even though non-species taxa could equally be involved in any eBird observation.\nRecord (Observation): a unique report of a species and its count; the most elemental piece of data in eBird.  \nSubmission (Checklist): an aggregation of one or multiple records along with metadata (e.g., date/time, observer, location) related to a unique data collection event. While checklists may contain multiple observations, each observation is associated with only one checklist.  \nObserver (eBirder, User): people who submit records, via checklists, to eBird. Throughout this document we distinguish users (the individuals creating records) from reviewers (i.e., regional editors; the individuals reviewing records).  \nEach observer in eBird is tied to an email address and a name. Some individuals may have multiple eBird accounts, and other accounts may be “group accounts” shared among multiple observers. While almost all observers display their real name, some use an alias. It is also possible to set your public display name as “Anonymous eBirder” via the eBird account settings. When observers opt to appear anonymously, we still show their real name in the Review Tools, but you’ll see Anonymous eBirder if you click over to view the checklist page in eBird. However, we ask that reviewers respect an observer’s decision to remain anonymous and not to share their first and last name with others.  \nSome users may opt to leave their first and last name blank, which is not preferred. As a reviewer, feel free to contact these users by email to ask them to enter their real name and then to set their Preferences to Anonymous eBirder or their real name as they wish. \nLocation: can be thought of as the point on the map where the data collection event occurred, but is more specifically defined by a Location identifier (e.g., L2141044; these are used in the URLs for hotspots, such as https://ebird.org/hotspot/L2141044), each of which has a unique latitude and longitude for map display as well as other attributes like country, state/province, county, whether or not it is a hotspot, and sometimes other attributes (whether it falls within a KBA/IBA, National Wildlife Refuge, etc.)  \nFilter: an automated data-verification procedure that checks each record against a predefined maximum count of that species for that date. We consider a filter to be the full list of possible species for a given region (could be country, state, county, or a custom region), with each species having its own Filter Limit. For more on how filters are set and used, see the Filters section below.  \nFilter Limits: the specific count values within a date range for a species within the context of a filter. Any given filter is thus made up of filter limits for all species on the filter. \nFlagged: when a record exceeds a filter limit, it is automatically labeled (“flagged”) to indicate it needs consideration by a regional editor. The Review Tools are designed to help regional editors identify, examine, and assign final decisions to flagged records or checklists. Reviewers can also flag observations manually from eBird checklists in their review region. \nPolygon: The region to which a filter is attached, such that all reports within the polygon will use the specific filter. A polygon can be a geopolitical region (country, state, county) or a custom polygon (Arbitrary Polygon) enabled by eBird Central. Note that one filter can be active for multiple polygons but that each polygon can only be connected to one filter.\nReview Decision, Status, and Reason: three separate designations that govern how and where records are displayed in the Review Tools and on public eBird output. Some of these designations are assigned automatically based on filters or reviewer actions, while others are manually specified by reviewers. See Review Decision, Status, and Reason below for more information.  \nMedia: photographs, audio recordings, or video files. Observers should always add mediadirectly to eBird checklists to ensure they are archived with Macaulay Library. eBird and the Macaulay Library are tightly integrated and review decisions on eBird observations or checklists also affect media in the Macaulay Library. \nDocumentation: any evidence added by an observer to support their record. Documentation consists of notes in the Species Details box and/or uploaded media files. Photos of sketches or field notes can also be considered as documentation but ideally should be tagged Field notes/sketch which a tag that is accessible from Manage Media. External archives, such as BRC files, photo websites (e.g., Flickr), or other web-based initiatives (e.g., iNaturalist) can also be linked to for documentation, but none of these are guaranteed to be permanent, so the best practice is to ensure thatall important documentation is stored within the checklist.",

Reviewers can also flag observations manually from eBird checklists in their review region. \nPolygon: The region to which a filter is attached, such that all reports within the polygon will use the specific filter. A polygon can be a geopolitical region (country, state, county) or a custom polygon (Arbitrary Polygon) enabled by eBird Central. Note that one filter can be active for multiple polygons but that each polygon can only be connected to one filter.\nReview Decision, Status, and Reason: three separate designations that govern how and where records are displayed in the Review Tools and on public eBird output. Some of these designations are assigned automatically based on filters or reviewer actions, while others are manually specified by reviewers. See Review Decision, Status, and Reason below for more information.  \nMedia: photographs, audio recordings, or video files. Observers should always add mediadirectly to eBird checklists to ensure they are archived with Macaulay Library. eBird and the Macaulay Library are tightly integrated and review decisions on eBird observations or checklists also affect media in the Macaulay Library. \nDocumentation: any evidence added by an observer to support their record. Documentation consists of notes in the Species Details box and/or uploaded media files. Photos of sketches or field notes can also be considered as documentation but ideally should be tagged Field notes/sketch which a tag that is accessible from Manage Media. External archives, such as BRC files, photo websites (e.g., Flickr), or other web-based initiatives (e.g., iNaturalist) can also be linked to for documentation, but none of these are guaranteed to be permanent, so the best practice is to ensure thatall important documentation is stored within the checklist.",

    "text": "In addition to reviewing whether observations are Accepted or Unconfirmed and whether checklists are Public or Not Public, the third major role for reviewers is ensuring that Exotic Codes for an observation are set correctly. Like observation review, these decisions affect display on regional output (e.g., Region Explorer pages). Unlike observation review, however, these also affect personal list totals for birders (and their Top100 stats). For these reasons, this is a role to be taken very seriously. Please take time to understand how Exotic species are handled in eBird before performing any of these reviews; consult with your review team or eBird Central if you need help. \nCollecting observations of exotic species in eBird is important and we have built a system to identify and tag these species with an Exotic Code, while still incentivizing the reporting of those that are breeding in self-propagating populations. Our goal (where reasonable to do so) is to apply an Exotic Code to all exotic species observations in eBird (native species receive no code). These codes are as follows (seedetailed definitions here): \n Naturalized: Exotic population is self-sustaining, breeding in the wild, persisting for many years, and not maintained through ongoing releases (including vagrants from Naturalized populations). These count in official eBird totals and, where applicable, have been accepted by regional bird records committee(s).\n Provisional: Either: 1) member of exotic population that is breeding in the wild, self-propagating, and has persisted for multiple years, but not yet Naturalized; 2) rarity of uncertain provenance, with natural vagrancy or captive provenance both considered plausible. When applicable, eBird generally defers to bird records committees for records formally considered to be of “uncertain provenance”. Provisional species count in official eBird totals.\n Escapee: Exotic species known or suspected to be escaped or released, including those that have bred but don’t yet fulfill the criteria for Provisional. Escapee exotics do not count in official eBird totals.\nThere are two ways that Exotic Codes are applied.  \n\nOur automatic system (affectionately known as The Matrix) stores Exotic Codes by region (e.g., country, state, or county) along with notes justifying that treatment. Upon data entry, a preliminary Exotic Code from The Matrix is applied to the record and in the vast majority of cases, these will be the correct final code. The Matrix is updated periodically, so if a species is not getting the correct preliminary code in your region, report the issue on ourChanges to the Exotics Matrix form or contact eBird Central directly.\n\n\n\nReviewers can change the Exotic Code for any Observation in their review region as well, as described below. When a reviewer applies an Exotic Code, a History is recorded as Last Reviewer Exotic Update (there is no history for Exotic Codes applied by The Matrix). Once a reviewer applies an Exotic Code, this will be the final Exotic Code and will not be changed by the automated system (even if the Matrix is changed). It will change in only two scenarios: 1) changed by a reviewer again; 2) location of checklist is moved across a county, state/province, or country boundary, in which case the Exotic Code will be reset by the automated system (the Last Reviewer Exotic Update history will be retained). When Exotic Codes are adjusted manually, please make sure to apply them consistently to all observations in a region, not just to a couple (or else the Exotic Code will not display correctly in regional summaries , maps, etc.).\n\nTo make a change to an Exotic Code, simply switch to Exotics Mode above the green bar on any eBird review screen (e.g., Review Queue, Search, History, or Submission pages). Once in Exotics Mode, the green bar will change to orange and the drop-down will include the four exotic categories: Escapee, Provisional, Naturalized, and native (selecting native will remove the Exotic Code altogether). The below examples show the process of changing a record of Budgerigars in Pinellas Co, Florida from Escapee (the default preliminary code from the Matrix) to Provisional, since it is from a time period when the population had a breeding population that met the qualifications for Provisional.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on “Change to exotics mode” just above the green bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the appropriate Exotic designation from the dropdown and enter Notes. You MUST enter a note before the system will let you click ‘Change’ on the right.\n\n\n\nNew exotic status and reviewer notes now display\n\n\nChanges can also be made in bulk in the Review Queue and Search. Switch to Exotics Mode, select all applicable records, apply an Exotic Designation, add Notes (required), and click the green Change button to update records in bulk. The below example will switch all records to Provisional once the green Change button is hit. \n\nWe expect reviewers to need to use Exotics Mode only rarely. Regionwide changes are best implemented via the Matrix, so report those to ourChanges to the Exotics Matrix form. The main cases where reviewers will need to make changes will be instances where more than one Exotic Code are needed for the species in a region, either because of geographical differences in Exotic Status or changes in Exotic Status over time (see below): both of these will be best addressed by using Search to find those records and then tagging them in bulk. In some cases, an individual record may need to be treated as native or Escapee (more rarely Naturalized or Provisional). Again, use Search to find those observations to adjust them. In such cases, we want to first confirm that the Matrix tag was the best guess for the region and that the record being changed is an exception that will be rare in the future. \nThe end goal here is to have the correct Exotic Code for each record. Please use Exotics Mode whenever needed to help correct the Exotic Code for records, just be aware that adjusting the Matrix will be a better solution if the majority of records need to get the same Exotic Code.  \nWe encourage reviewers to review and accept all records of free-flying Exotic species (provided they are correctly identified) and to ensure that the correct Exotic Code is applied. Formerly, some records were treated as Unconfirmed with reason Species-Introduced/Exotic but it is no longer appropriate to mark an Exotic species Unconfirmed if it is free-flying and correctly identified.. \nIn general, Naturalized and Provisional species should be included on your filter(s), and some very frequent Escapee species may also deserve to be on your filter, as long as you have confidence that most reports of the species will be correct. \n\n\nThe Matrix does not include dates, so we depend on reviewers to maintain consistent data over time. But every Exotic species obviously has a period that predated their introduction where records might have only pertained to Escapees; this is very uncommon but is not a major problem: Exotic species are generally absent or nearly absent until they are introduced (for example, there were no reports of Swinhoe’s White-eyes in California prior to their introduction in 2006). For Naturalized species (and Provisional species), we do consider it valid to treat them as Provisional or Naturalized from the moment of introduction that led to their expansion and colonization. Thus the white-eyes would earn Provisional status starting in 2006 (they are currently still Provisional) and once Naturalized, the records all the way back to 2006 would count as Naturalized. But a record from 1985 would be treated as Escapee, since it was not part of the population that led to colonization.\nLess commonly, native species or Naturalized exotics have become extirpated (although in the latter cases, it is worth considering if Naturalized status was truly achieved and if perhaps those records are better treated as Escapee; note that Provisional species revert to Escapee status if the population becomes extirpated). When this happens, reviewers may want to treat them as Naturalized between a certain range of years, and Escapee thereafter. For example, Northern Bobwhite historically occurred as a native species north to southern New Hampshire. As of 2024, most populations north of Virginia have been extirpated and in many regions (New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and all of Massachusetts except Cape Cod) the species only occurs when individuals are periodically released. Thus, most of these states have a specific date after which all records are treated as Escapee, The Matrix has been set to account for the modern status, and the species is flagged as a rarity in those areas. Older records have been reviewed and changed to native status and newly submitted records can be left as Escapee for modern records and changed manually to native if someone enters a historical sighting from the period when the species occurred naturally.\n\n\n\nShip-assisted birds are those that travel a significant portion of a voyage over open water on a ship; many Nearctic landbirds have been found in European ports on or near transatlantic ships, for example. Similarly, House Crow is renowned for traveling much of the world on ships and even establishing colonies based on these ship-assisted travels. Though different record-keeping authorities treat ship-assisted birds in different ways, within eBird these records should always be accepted if the identification is correct and the rarities are adequately documented. Please clearly indicate in Reviewer comments that the record is considered a likely or certain ship-assist. However, since ship-assistance can also involve active or passive restraint and relocation of birds (not unlike transporting and releasing a captive bird) it can sometimes be appropriate to also apply an Exotic Code to these observations. Below are our recommendations; these apply to both seabirds (e.g., Red-footed Booby) and terrestrial birds (e.g., White-throated Sparrow): \n\nFor a healthy (i.e., able to fly readily) bird that may ride a ship for a short distance into port, treat it as native unless it is known to have traveled with the ship, without leaving, for 300+ km or for many days of travel (e.g., a ship-riding Red-footed Booby in Alaska). \n\n\n\nFor a healthy (i.e., able to fly readily) bird that is known to have traveled with the ship, without leaving, for 300+ km or for many days of travel, please treat it as Provisional (for example, House Crow in South Korea and Great-tailed Grackle in Hawaii).\n\n\n\nFor a bird that is unhealthy (i.e., not able to fly readily), fed, or restrained, please treat it as Escapee if the travel on a ship brings it to a new region (for example, Hawfinch in California or Cape Verde Sparrow in the Netherlands). \n\n\n\n\nWildlife rehabilitators often take in interesting species. If a rehabilitator submits a record of a bird, it is important that: 1) its location be plotted at the location and date that it was recovered from the wild; 2) documentation may then be submitted from captivity, if needed, even if it is taken on a later date. This is a special case where the date of the photo may not match the date of observation, since this is a scenario where it is known that the same bird is involved. Additional records should not be submitted while the bird is captive. Once the bird is released, it may be submitted to eBird again but in some cases we recommend marking these records as Provisional. For example, records of a Red-necked Grebe and Clapper Rail recovered somewhere in downtown New York City and later released in Central Park resulted in non-natural occurrence in the park. For these reasons, this is a special case where Provisional status may be used to signify non-natural occurrence. \n\n\n\nThere are a few other special cases where reviewing a record in Exotic Mode is appropriate. \nThese include: \n\nRecords of species that may pertain either to wild vagrants or Escapees; these should be reviewed as Provisional if either option really feels possible. They can be updated at a later time if additional research (including Bird Records Committee decisions) determine the record to pertain to a native vagrant or an Escapee.\n\n\n\nChecklists involving Captive Species (See the Captive Species review reason below); in addition to being marked Unconfirmed through record review or being marked Not Public through Checklist-level review (see Not Public, Checklist-Captive Species below), captive species can be treated as Escapee. This ensures that they are not counted in personal list totals or Top100. While eBird reviewers are not list police, this is a chance to ensure that Top100 reflects consistent rules for all and excludes captives.",

    "text": "The basic task here is to Accept or Unconfirm unusual species and numbers. Please try to keep your list of review records as short as possible by reviewing the observations on a regular basis. Remember that review decisions remain in the database and any observation can be rereviewed at any time. \n\n\nEach row in the Review Queue has the basic information you will need to review a record (either directly on the page or through links). Some records will require you to examine the records to contact the observer for details or to check the observation page, which provides a useful link to Quick Review. The process below describes two methods by which records are reviewed on any page of the Review Tools.  \n\n\n\nClick on the email icon next to any record. From here you’ll see a template with three options: Unconfirm, Defer, or Accept. In most cases, you’ll choose Unconfirm or Accept. See this sectionfor more information on Defer. \nYou’ll be presented with a smaller modal to select a Review Decision (a default most likely one will be pre-selected) and the option to send an email. \nWe strongly encourage sending emails especially when Unconfirming a record so that users know how their records are being treated; this also gives them the opportunity to add more notes and potentially media.

    "text": "Introduction \nThank you for your willingness to assist with reviewing eBird records. eBird reviewers like you are selected not only for your knowledge and skill with bird identification and understanding of bird distribution patterns, but also for your interpersonal skills and connections to the birding community. As an eBird reviewer, we hope you not only use eBird regularly but will set an example for best eBirding practices and will provide mentorship in your correspondence with eBirders. We strongly recommend that all eBird editors take the free, briefeBird Essentials Course and understand how to communicate the basic concepts discussed in the course. \nYou will interact with eBirders of all skill levels, from rank amateurs to professional ornithologists. Humility and tact are essential in your correspondences, and we hope that the focus is on finding the truth and ensuring exceptional records are exceptionally well-documented. We also hope you’ll recognize that birds are dependent on inviting as many people as possible into our wonderful field, and that you’ll have patience in your interactions with people who have just started learning their local birds, for example, with Merlin Sound ID. \nYou will represent the eBird project as one of the primary points of contact for our user community. Please do what you can to encourage users in a supportive manner and help build the eBird community. People make mistakes. We encourage you to contact and assist them. If you continually treat records as Unconfirmed without letting people know, they are unlikely to learn, will keep making the same mistakes, and this will ultimately take more time. \nData quality is of paramount importance at eBird. Many of us currently are on records committees or have been in the past, and we take documenting rarities very seriously. It is an ongoing challenge to identify and assess data coming into eBird. We will continue to develop new ways of exploring the data that will help to bring potentially erroneous records to light, but we depend on you to discover and assess these records in your region. \nThere are three main components to this document, Part I covers using the review tools, Part II covers filter creation and editing, and Part III covers important policies and guidelines. \nNOTE: This document is the November 2025 version and is always available at this link in the eBird Help Center:https://tinyurl.com/eBirdReview. Please use this link to access the latest version of this document. \nMost importantly, thank you for your help in building eBird and making it better. Without you, eBird would not exist. If there is anything we can do to help, please contact us at any time.  \nThank you, \nMarshall Iliff: mji26@cornell.edu \nJenna Curtis: jenna.curtis@cornell.edu  \nJohn Garrett: jfg228@cornell.edu",

    "text": "When you’re logged in to eBird, you can review any eBird checklist in your assignment region. Here’s an example of a public checklist (https://ebird.org/checklist/S45355741):\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown above, review options on public eBird checklists appear as flag icons. Clicking the flag next to the observation will open Quick Review; click History if you prefer to see that page or to use the default email. If you don’t see the icons, you are not logged in, are looking at a checklist from outside your review assignment area, or you do not have review privileges properly enabled. \nNote: eBird checklists will include ALL species reported by the observer, including those already deemed Unconfirmed. When you are logged in as a reviewer, for checklists in your review region, Sensitive Species will also be visible only to you and the checklist owner(s) and will be clearly marked; Sensitive Species will not be visible to the general public.  \n\n\n\nAs an eBird reviewer, one of your major roles is to ensure all photos are correctly identified. Even if an Observation is otherwise correct, a single misidentified photo in an Observation means that Observation should be treated as Unconfirmed (until it is corrected). It may be helpful to add a reviewer for your region to focus solely on media issues. In November 2015 we added the ability to drag-and-drop photos and audio recordings directly in eBird checklists via the Macaulay Library. This process automatically assigns the photo metadata including the species of the bird, count, date, location, and more, and archives the photo as a digital specimen akin to a museum specimen. You may find misidentified photos when browsing records in your region, but your Review Queue will also include misidentified photos found by others.  \nWho are “Media Reviewers”?\nMedia reviewers include all regional editors and all eBirders that have submitted 100 or more complete checklists in the previous year. Media Reviewers have the ability toflag incorrect media, as described below. Regional Editors are enabled with global Media Review permissions. Media Reviewers who are not also regional editors do NOT have other review privileges. They cannot access the Review Queue, see review History, review individual records on public checklists, etc.  \nHow does Media Review work?\nIf a Media Reviewer finds a misidentified photo, sound, or video whilebrowsing eBird, clicking on that photo will give them the option to “Report” it with additional details. It is helpful to refer to specific media asset from the checklist (possibly including the Macaulay Library link). The Offensive or inappropriate content option is intended only for vulgar, rude, or otherwise inappropriate content, not misidentifications or photos of non-birds. \n\n\n\nWhen media are flagged, the record appears with the status Rereview and reason Species-Media ID Questioned. Remember that records could have been flagged for Rereview for another reason. Always check the History on such records to see why it was flagged and make sure to check the Media reviewer’s comments. \n\n\nHow should I review incorrectly identified photos?\nIf any photo is not correct, the observer should be contacted and asked to fix it. Using the reason Unconfirm, Species-Misidentified provides an email format that gives all the relevant information on Change Species and is by far the best and most efficient way to email observers about these types of issues. It is always nice to include some relevant field marks or resources when you contact the observer and to try to refer to the specific photo(s) that need fixing. Please also steer them to theChange Species article to correct the media.  \nBe aware that when photos are reidentified and moved between species, often the observers need to change the count as well. For example, if two Laughing Gulls were reported, but one image showed a Franklin’s Gull, then the Laughing Gull count should probably be reduced to one. Remember also that when observers use Change Species to move media, the status will change to Rereview, ensuring that you will see the record again so you can check that the correct changes were made. However, if the observer deletes photos, they will have to contact you in order for the record to be Rereviewed. \nWhy do some media not have a Report flag?\nAny piece of media that appears on an eBird checklist, and has a Macaulay Library link, has been uploaded via the normal eBird upload process. However, please note that it remains possible to have “embedded” media that displays media from other websites (e.g., Flickr, Facebook, Picasa, iNaturalist) in eBird checklists and these do not have the Report button. While these can be useful for verification of a record, we do not consider this a best practice for eBird, since these links can be easily lost or broken through changes by the third-party website. Please encourage users to upload directly to eBird whenever possible, but please do accept such records when the photo confirms the identification. Also, please note that when using Media Search tools, including Illustrated Checklist galleries, some media (especially audio and video) will be delivered from the master Macaulay Library archive and these are not (yet) associated with eBird checklists. To report an error on these, email Jay McGowan (jwm57@cornell.edu). \n\n\n\nChange Species makes it easy for observers to revise an entire record, with all associated metadata and media, to a new species. When an eBirder uses Change Species for an entire observation, any previous review decisions are preserved in History, but the record is rerun through the filters as though for the first time. Thus, if a record considered Unconfirmed is revised using Change Species and the new taxon it is changed to is not flagged, then it will be treated as Accepted and Unreviewed since it will not have been flagged by the filter.  \nHow are species changes indicated in review history?\nA reason of Species-Identification Changed will also appear in History along with an entry in Reviewer Notes that says something like “Taxon changed from semsan to litsti”. The alphanumeric codes after “from” and “to” refer to the previous and current taxon of the record, respectively. The common names corresponding to these codes can be found bydownloading the eBird taxonomy or by pasting the species code to the end of a species page (e.g., for “litsi” enterhttps://ebird.org/species/litsti). In this example, the taxon was changed from Semipalmated Sandpiper (“semsan”, Calidris pusilla) to Little Stint (“litsti”, Calidris minuta). \nWe use the eBird code in this case because 1) they are more constant, regardless of changes in taxonomy or nomenclature; 2) they do not require translation to the Reviewer’s language preference, which would not be possible here.  \nWill species changes always cause a record to resurface for review?\nSometimes an observer needs to delete a photo or use Change Species to move a single photo to the correct species. For records that are Unconfirmed, using Change Species to move media to or from a given species will trigger either record for Rereview if the observation had been marked Unconfirmed. Thus, moving a photo from American Coot to American Wigeon will not trigger Rereview if neither record has been marked Unconfirmed. But if the reviewer marked the coot Unconfirmed, because it had a photo showing a wigeon, the American Coot record will be flagged for rereview once the media are moved so the reviewer can check this. Note that deleting a single piece of media will not change the overall record’s review status and will not cause it to resurface in the queue, so observers must notify the reviewer once such actions have been taken; see also the note at the end of the above Rereview Status section. See also the section below, since eBird Central changes during taxonomic updates will not trigger rereview.\nSpecies changes from taxonomic updates by eBird Central\neBird updates its taxonomy once annually to align with the most modern science on species limits and nomenclature in birds. When these updates happen, staff at eBird Central adjust observations to align with the new taxonomy whenever it is safe to do so (i.e., when the location or date of an observation could only pertain to one species). These updates use a special tool at eBird Central and starting in 2024 these updates have treated records in two special ways:\n\nWe assume that eBird Central is making changes that reviewers would approve of and that the change to a new taxon is the correct one. For example, when Herring Gull was split, all reports of Herring Gull Larus argentatus from Panama that lacked subspecies designation were presumed to pertain to American Herring Gull Larus smithsonianus (if the observer had specified the subspecies, that identification would have been retained after the split, of course). Since Herring Gull is a rarity there, all records had already been reviewed and approved by a reviewer. Even though eBird Central moved the records from Larus argentatus (sensu lato) to Larus smithsonianus, which is a more refined identification, we also retain the previous review outcome. Thus, if the record was Reviewed and Accepted, we retain that and if the record had been treated as Unconfirmed with reason Documentation-Inadequate, we also retain that.\nWhenever these changes occur, a row is entered in History that describes the taxonomic change and also includes text like this: “Taxon changed from hergul to amhgul1 [taxonomic update from eBird Central; previous review outcome retained]”",

    "text": "Reviewer Essentials \nThanks for being a part of the eBird review team! Here’s everything you should need to get started—the rest of the document outlines our review tools and best practices in more detail.  \nReviewer agreement. Cornell University requires all volunteers to sign our Reviewer Agreement. This includes key information on roles and sets expectations. Please sign! You can review eBird’s volunteer roles and expectations here.\nYou are the face of eBird. You will often be the primary eBird contact point for eBirders in your region. Please maintain polite and helpful discourse with eBirders you reach out to. Most are genuinely interested in improving their checklists and documenting their sightings and are grateful to have an expert like you to correspond with. We also expect polite discourse from eBirders—please reach out to eBird Central if there’s ever conflict. \nWhere do I log in? https://review.ebird.org/admin/. Use your eBird username and password. Bookmark this link but note that ebird.org/admin also redirects here and is easier to remember. \nHow can I be onboarded? The best way to learn how to review eBird records is to have another reviewer in your area introduce you to the process, to their favorite tips and tricks, and to discuss how their regional team works. Second, we do have a set of powerpoint presentations that discuss the important elements of eBird review, including Review Philosophy, Observation review, Filters, Checklist review, and Other topics (including Search, Exotics, and Media review). Reviewing these short slide decks should be enough to get started and to understand the most important aspects of review. Finally, this document contains full detail on everything you need to know. We recommend reading—or at least skimming—this document. Keep it on hand and bookmark this link, since any question you have can be looked up here.\nHow do I access records for review? There are two ways to access records for review: \n\nReview Tools: The Review Tools are the primary interface to review records.  \n\n\n\neBird checklists: You can also access Review Tools by going to any checklist for your review area, clicking Review next to a sighting, or clicking the Review button (the flag icon) at the top right. \n\nHow do I review a record? There are two primary methods for reviewing records: \nFirst method: \n\nClick on the email icon next to an observer’s name in the queue. This action will prompt a modal window to open for making a review decision. \nChoose one of the options presented at the bottom of the modal, typically either Accept or Unconfirm. \n\nAccept records you are confident are correct.\nUnconfirm records for which you want to ask more details or you are confident are wrong\nDefer records only in specific situations where you want to ask the observer for more details, but the observation is within the last 7 days and you want to keep the record visible on alerts.\n\nDecide whether to send an email, which will automatically populate with an appropriate customizable template. We highly recommend sending an email whenever possible, especially when Unconfirming. Sending an email can also be a thoughtful gesture when Accepting a record. \n\nSecond method (bulk reviewing): \n\nAlternatively, review records directly from the queue by checking the box(es) on the left next to the desired record(s). \nSelect a Review Decision and Review Reason from the dropdowns available in the green bar at the top. Optionally, you can add notes. \nClick on Change to confirm your decision. \n\nNote: This second method does not support emailing observers but offers a convenient way to bulk review multiple records. \nPlease also consider whether the checklist details are OK (location accurate, reported from single date, etc.). If not, you can apply a tag to the entire checklist to indicate that a problem was found. \nHow do I identify a problem with the entire checklist? When on the checklist review page, you have the option to select a reason and mark an entire checklist as Not Public. This is recommended in cases of a location issue (badly misplotted), very long lists that cover multiple habitats (checklists that are 8km or less should never be considered problematic for distance), list-building lists, imprecise dates, or other lists. This adds a public message at the top of the list and removes all observations from public view until the issues are resolved. We ask that you always consider checklist-level review before reviewing observations.\nWhere do I change the data quality filter for my region? The data quality filter controls what gets flagged for your region. To see the filter limits for a species, simply click the Filter link on the right-hand side of any record. This will open the filter that flagged the record. If your assignment includes filter editing, you can adjust the ‘filter limits’ by date for each species. Once you adjust these, any NEW records submitted below this threshold will not be flagged for review; hitting Run on the filter applies these to older records that do not have a prior review decision. You can also click the Filters tab on the upper right to open and review or edit the entire filter for your region. You can also add new taxa here (please see eBird Filters for more information).\nReview as a team when you can. Most reviewers fill several roles, such as Observation Reviewer, Checklist-level reviewer, and Filter Editor, while others (particularly hotspot editors) may focus on a specific area. What matters most is clear coordination. Strong teams often assign responsibilities regionally (e.g., one, two or several people reviewing for specific subregion, where they also manage the filter and manage hotspots) with a Review Coordinator who manages who is doing what, helps ensure the team is operating at its best, and helps ensure that revie wis happening regularly and that data quality at the broad level is strong. If your region lacks coverage for a key function, such as a filter editor, hotspot editor, Review Coordinator, please get in touch. We’re here to help you think about whether adding another reviewer or redistributing responsibilities will strengthen your team.\nAn ideal review teams consists of:\n\n\nReview Coordinators - oversee review in a given region, serving as primary liaison between eBird Central and review teams\neBird Mentors - assist review teams to train, educate, assist, and answer questions from the user community, especially for users still learning eBird standards and protocols.\neBird Observation Reviewers - primarily responsible for eBird data quality in a given region, including, but not limited to, acting upon records flagged by eBird filters. Review of media attached to observations is also included.\neBird Checklist Reviewers - primarily responsible for tagging eBird Checklists as Public or Not Public, in accordance with eBird standards. \neBird Filter Editors - primarily responsible for creating, managing, and maintaining the regional eBird filters that determine which species appear for data entry, which observations require documentation from observers, and which observations are automatically flagged for review. \neBird Hotspot Editors - primarily responsible for the creation, naming, and management of eBird Hotspots in a region in compliance with eBird guidelines.\nFor more details on the responsibilities and expectations of each of these roles, please see: eBird Volunteer Roles and Expectations. Most reviewers serve as Observation Reviewers and Checklist Reviewers, and many also manage their regional filter as a Filter Editor as well. Many observation reviewers also assist with hotspots in their region as a Hotspot Reviewer, but this role can easily be assigned to others to grow the team and help share the responsibilities more broadly.\nThank you for everything that you do to make eBird’s continued success possible.",

    "text": "Review Decisions and Reason email templates \nThe review reasons available in Quick Review and by clicking on an email icon next to a record in the queue are a streamlined list relevant for records with documentation. Please see Appendix A for a full description of review reasons.  \nEach review reason includes a custom email template and all have an option to a custom text block to provide the observer with more information. We recommend reading these emails before sending; opening the email will display it, but it won’t be sent until you hit Send. We strongly recommend adding a short note in the box provided to personalize your emails. Setting these off with boldface and italics helps make sure the observer does not miss this text. \nYou always have the option to send or not send the email, but this must be designated when the first box pops up and allows you to set your reason; just check or uncheck the Send Email box. If you choose to send an email, the review actions will be finalized when the email is sent. Note that Shared checklists will have all participants on the checklist CCed by default; you can uncheck those whom you don’t wish to email. \nEmail templates for Accept\n\nAccept: Checking Send email will also send a thank you note to the observer. Please use this for any particularly well-documented record or just to say thanks to anyone or mention something interesting about a record you are accepting. This injects some great positivity into the process! \n\nEmail templates for Unconfirm and Defer\n\nDocumentation Inadequate-Count: This email asks the observer for more documentation on a high count and explains why it is important, and links toour article on counting birds. \n\n\n\nDocumentation Inadequate-Species: This email asks the observer for more documentation on a rare record, explains why it is important, and links to our article on documenting rare birds.  \n\n\n\nMedia-ID questioned: This email is specifically for records that include correctly identified media mixed with incorrectly identified media. This could be a drag-and-drop error or misidentification. The email explains to fix this using Change Species. NOTE: This email will appear unfinished if you do not add text in the target box. \n\n\n\nMerlin ID-Documentation Inadequate: This template is the same as Documentation Inadequate-Species, but tailored specifically to circumstances when you know or strongly suspect the user was uncritically accepting an ID generated by the Merlin app. It encourages the recipient to identify the bird for themselves. \n\n\n\nMerlin ID-Species Misidentified: This template is the same as Species-Misidentified but tailored specifically to circumstances when you know or strongly suspect the user was uncritically accepting an ID generated by the Merlin app. It encourages the recipient to identify the bird for themselves. \n\n\n\nSpecies-Misidentified: This email explains that a species has been misidentified and gives instructions for how to make the correction using Change Species. NOTE: This email will appear unfinished if you do not add text in the target box, hopefully including the correct species and some additional helpful ID notes. \n\n\n\nSpecies-Taxonomic Issue: This email explains that the issue with the record is more from confusion over the selected name or recent taxonomic revision and suggests how to make this change. Please read more about this reason in Appendix A and understand how to use it correctly. NOTE: This email will appear unfinished if you do not add text in the target box, hopefully explaining the issue briefly. \n\nAs with all records with a Deferred status, if you want to keep records in your queue indefinitely, immediately mark Unconfirmed with a reason of Species-Rereview Requested. \nSeveral other reasons in Quick Review (BRC-Rejected, Observer-Error) are rarely used and have a generic template under Unconfirm that is similar to the one used in traditional review but without a request for more documentation. These email templates need you to fill in some information about the problem, if you use them.",

    "text": "Sequence of the eBird Review process \nHaving a fundamental understanding of the Review Queue and terms, you are now ready to review records. The majority of records are very easy to review, and simply require a quick look at the date, location, count, and documentation for the species. However, we hope that during this process reviewers are mentally checking three main factors in sequence:  \n\nIs the checklist acceptable? Your first step in any review should be to consider whether the checklist is suitable for public display in eBird. In almost all cases the answer is yes, but if it is not (i.e., location is not accurately plotted, date is inaccurate or spans multiple days, is an obvious life list entry, or is otherwise unsuitable for eBird’s scientific database) then the entire checklist should be reviewed: see Checklist-level review below. The investigation of checklist-level issues is important because a problematic checklist likely will also include additional Accepted records, but these should not be used for science or public output if the entire checklist is problematic. \n \n\n\n\nIs the observation acceptable? Review and assessment of the species identity and count is the core of the eBird review process. Remember that the filters are not perfect and may flag expected species (or fail to catch unusual ones). Every review should focus on the documentation provided but should also consider the record in context. The nuances of this decision are discussed at length below.\n \n\n\n\nAre all media in the checklist correct? All photos, audio, and video from Public checklists and Accepted observations are used in media galleries and other products in the Macaulay Library. For this reason, it is important that reviewers also help to address errors with media. It is not uncommon for birders to make mistakes uploading media. These cases are discussed in detail in the Media review section. \n\nIf all three elements of an observation are OK, in the reviewer’s opinion, the report can be Accepted. If any has a problem, the issue should be addressed as discussed in the sections below: Checklist-level review, Observation review, or Media review. These are not listed in this sequence below, since Observation review is by far the most common scenario.",

    "text": "What records appear in the Review Queue? \nRecords are “flagged” for the Review Queue primarily through an automated process involving expert-created filters (see Part II for more on filters). These filters set expected counts by date for each species in each region. Records are flagged by filters for the following reasons:  \n\nRarity: a species that is rare or unusual in the region; these species are set to a limit of zero year-round on filters. \n\n\n\nOut-of-season report: a species reported outside its normal date range in a region; these filters are set to zero for that species only within a certain date range. \n\n\n\nHigh count: a species count that exceeds a non-zero filter value, which represents the maximum number one might expect to find in the region on a particular date.  \n\n\n\nNot on checklist: meaning the species is not included on your filter at all. Examples include a first state record, a record new to the region, novel Escapee exotics, newly-recorded hybrids, or even regular subspecies or spuhs (e.g., scoter sp.) that are not shown on the current checklist. If the bird is expected and deserves to be on the list of species, please be sure to add it to the filter! Note that we don’t recommend including all subspecies options, but distinctive and well-known ones should be included, especially when two or more occur in a region. \n\n\n\nPost-submission edits: certain edits made by users (e.g., change of species, change of date of observations, change of location, or increase in the count) will trigger a re-check of the filter and that may result in the record being flagged after initial submission. In addition, the process of a checklist being marked Not Public and then Public again means it will be treated as a new submission. \n\n\n\nRecords for Rereview: There are several additional ways that a record can appear in the Review Queue, including records flagged by Media Reviewers as potential photo errors or records set to Rereview by a reviewer. They all appear with Status of Rereview, highlighted in orange. Be sure to always read the History for any record set to Rereview. Please see Rereview Status below for more on these. \n\nHow often are flagged records added to the Review Queue?\nRecords are harvested by the “Review Robot” once every 15 minutes for the Review Queue. Any newly-submitted or recently-edited record that is not already in the Review Queue, and exceeds a filter, will be added at this time.  \nWhy was this unexceptional record flagged for review?\nIf a record is harvested for the Review Queue because of a high count and the eBirder later reduces the count to a value that is not flagged by the filter, this does not remove the record from the Review Queue. This can sometimes make it seem as if the record was flagged erroneously. The last edited date on the Submission Page may be helpful, since it could show an edit since the record was flagged, but note that reviewers sending emails are also logged as changes here. These records are usually easy decisions and can be accepted using a Review Reason of Record-Not exceptional (See Appendix A). Note that running your filters will remove these records from the queue.
