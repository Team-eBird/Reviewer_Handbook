## Sensitive Species 

In November 2017 eBird added a new Sensitive Species process. Certain species at risk from human exploitation are automatically tagged as Sensitive, which hides those records from eBird output. These records still must be reviewed and accepted by eBird reviewers, but since they are Sensitive we expect that observers will not share these records publicly. eBird reviewers can also mark specific records as Sensitive (see reason Species-Sensitive in [Appendix A](Review_Reasons.qmd)). See more, including the list of species treated as Sensitive, in our[ Sensitive Species article](https://support.ebird.org/support/solutions/articles/48000803210).
