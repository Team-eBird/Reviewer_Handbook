## Comparing Filters 

This new tool (released June 2019) allows direct comparison of filter limits for any species (or other taxon) between checklist filters within a given region (county, state, country). Editors with permissions to edit two or more active filters can click the hyperlinked name of any species and see all filter limits for that species on filters they have permissions to edit. The reviewer can copy, edit, and save the filter limits using the same tools described above for filter editing. You will only see filters you have permissions to edit; if you want to compare to adjacent regions, please ask your regional coordinator or eBird Central about expanding your filter editing privileges. 

When you click the species name you will be taken to a page showing all filter limits for species within the parent region.  

If you are looking at a county filter, and you click a species, you'll get the filter limits for that species within the parent state/province/district. If you are looking at a state/province/district filter, and you click the species, you'll get all the filters within that country. Similarly, if you have Arbitrary Polygons, these will be displayed for the "parent region", which is determined by the region code at the beginning of the polygon’s name (not the filter name). You can check the name of your polygons by clicking the Regions link; if the name does not begin with a region code and it is not behaving as expected, we will have to rename the polygon at eBird Central. 

**Additional tips when comparing filters:**

-   The **Filter** box can be useful if you have logical filter names and only want to work on a certain region at a given time. Because filters are arranged alphabetically, this tool is most useful if similar filters share similar names. Contact us for help renaming filters to make sure that they cluster together in useful ways.

-   Try adjusting your browser zoom to a level that works best for you. Note that the page title (e.g., "Alabama Snow Goose - Anser caerulescens Filter Comparison") may not appear in full at higher zoom levels, but this depends also on your screen size.

-   It is not possible to delete a species from a filter on this interface, although you can easily set the count limit to zero. To delete a species, just click the filter name (which is a hyperlink), open the filter, make the deletion, save, and then you can use your "browser back" button to return to the filter comparison page. 

**Comparing filters for rarities**

We clearly indicate filters that don’t contain a species with the phrase “\[NOT ON FILTER\]”. Copy and paste limits from an existing filter to quickly add the species to the filter that previously did not have the species.
