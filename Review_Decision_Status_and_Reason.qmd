# Review Decision, Status, and Reason 

Reviewing consists of assigning a Decision, Status, and Reason to each record in your queue. Therefore, before you can commence the review process, it is critical to understand what these different designations mean.  

## Review Decision 

Review Decision can be either Unconfirmed or Accepted and governs whether a record is displayed publicly on eBird. Only Accepted records appear in eBird science products (e.g., eBird Basic Dataset, Status & Trends) and eBird output (maps, graphs, etc.). Unconfirmed records are not shown in public eBird output or science products with two exceptions: Alerts and Media searches (or galleries) may show and clearly indicate Unconfirmed records that are also Unreviewed (see Review Status, below); Alerts only show those submitted in the past 7 days and Media searches show those only when clearly specified by the user.  

Review Decision has no bearing on personal data displays for observers (e.g., Life Lists, other list totals, profile maps, Top100 totals). Much like someone’s original field notes, both Accepted and Unconfirmed species are displayed in full, without indication of Review Decision, on an eBirder’s personal checklists. (Note: we use the terms Accepted and Unconfirmed, as opposed to Valid and Not Valid, since they more directly express the decision by the reviewer and are less pejorative.)

## Review Reason 

The review reason is a short explanation for your review decision. **Please make sure you fully understand the [Review Reasons in Appendix A](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gmi74SDISCWFA1CJbfjHqtc4yLOPHlWg9LolSBdFNI0/edit#heading=h.sglyuhchgvet).** The drop-down lists show review reasons specific to Accepted or Unconfirmed decisions. In order to Accept or Unconfirm a record you **must** provide a reason. This is very important, since your decisions may be reconsidered later if there is no reason to defend why a certain action was taken. Review Reason is always selected by the reviewer except when Deferred records exceed their time limit (see Deferred status below) when this process is partly automated. (Note however that older review decisions will not always have review reasons.) 

## Review Status 

Review Status is a designation set by automated processes or by reviewers. A record’s Review Status can be: 

### **Reviewed**

This Review Status can be associated with either Accepted or Unconfirmed records and indicates that a record has been reviewed.

### **Unreviewed** 

This Review Status can be associated with either Accepted or Unconfirmed records and indicates that a record has not been reviewed.

### **Rereview**

Anytime you find a record set to Rereview you should click the History to understand why. The Rereview Status always appears in orange and can indicate any of the following:\
\

-   **Media added to Unconfirmed record:** Any record marked Unconfirmed that then has media added will resurface for Rereview. This gives the reviewer a chance to decide if the record was actually correct.  

-   **Media moved to or from Unconfirmed records**: Any record with misidentified media should be marked Unconfirmed after notifying the user. Transferring media to or from a record using Change Species also triggers any flagged record to be set to Unconfirmed, Rereview. For example, if a Parasitic Jaeger record has a count of two individuals, two photos of Parasitic and one photo of Long-tailed, the observer should be notified to move their misidentified photo to the correct species. Supposing the Long-tailed Jaeger had also been marked Unconfirmed (perhaps for lack of documentation!), transferring the photo to Long-tailed Jaeger would ensure that a reviewer would review it again and we would also want a reviewer to check that the Parasitic Jaeger photos and count are now correct (probably the observer should tally one Parasitic Jaeger now). If Change Species is not used, there is no automated way to re-flag these records; please rereview if found though!

-   **Media Review: Media reviewers and reviewers with permissions in your area can flag misidentified media, which puts it in Rereview. See [Review Media](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gmi74SDISCWFA1CJbfjHqtc4yLOPHlWg9LolSBdFNI0/edit#heading=h.iltcad6i52ha) and Media-ID Questioned under [Review Reasons with Unconfirm](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gmi74SDISCWFA1CJbfjHqtc4yLOPHlWg9LolSBdFNI0/edit#heading=h.lgxjvic5lpfq) for more information.**

-   **Notes added to certain records:** Any record with a reason of Documentation Inadequate (including Documentation Inadequate-Species, Documentation Inadequate-Count, or Merlin ID-Documentation Inadequate) will resurface for review if documentation is edited or added, including adding media or editing comments. This applies to records with a status of Deferred or Unconfirmed. 

-   **Record manually set to rereview by another reviewer: Other reviewers with permissions in your area, including a small number with global permissions, can manually set records to Rereview. See Species-Rereview Requested under [Other Review Reasons](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gmi74SDISCWFA1CJbfjHqtc4yLOPHlWg9LolSBdFNI0/edit#heading=h.vgagrtcr1mzo) for more information.**

Click on the History link in the Review Queue to learn who has flagged the record for Rereview; click the name to contact that reviewer if you need information regarding the Status change.  

### **Deferred**

**This status is to be used only in special circumstances.** Deferred indicates a reviewer has sent the observer a request for more information and is pending reply, but also wants to keep the record visible on alerts.   

**What happens to records when they are Deferred?** Deferred records remain in the Review Queue for 14 days and also appear on eBird Alerts if the observation date is within the past 7 days (the period of eBird Alerts). Once the 14-day period has elapsed, the Deferred record will be marked Unconfirmed and Reviewed **if it is a record that exceeds the filter limit.** If at any time the observer adds media, or if records tagged as Documentation Inadequate have edits to Species Details, the record will appear in the queue with a status of Rereview and will remain visible until a reviewer makes a final decision.

Importantly, **if the record does not exceed the filter limits, it will return to a status of Accepted and Unreviewed** when the Defer period expires or when a filter is rerun. These records that are allowed by the filter remain that way until a reviewer makes a final decision on the record (including Rereview). Therefore, we strongly recommend reviewing unflagged records as Unconfirmed instead of Deferred. Note that if you want to keep such a record visible in Needs Alerts, using the review reason Species-Rereview Requested will do this and will not have an automatic change of status later. 

**When to use Defer:** We recommend using Defer for recent records that may be correct, but where more information is needed. The main reason to Defer a record is to retain its visibility in Alerts.  

It is very important that reviewers use Defer correctly: if the record can be resolved immediately using Unconfirmed, we recommend that you do so. If the record can be assigned a tentative final decision, we also recommend implementing this immediately. Remember that Unconfirmed record will return to the Review Queue if the eBirder adds media (or uses Change Species to adjust media). For records Reviewed or Deferred with reason Documentation-Inadequate, the record will return to the Review Queue if the eBirder adds or edits their Species Details. These will appear as Species-Rereview Requested and a History line will be added to explain what happened. If the observer just replies to your email, you should have the checklist link accessible in the email to check on the decision also. Records from past years almost never should be Deferred, and it is better to make a tentative decision immediately with the understanding that addition of more documentation will also give an opportunity to reassess. 

**Deferred records will not appear in Quick Review** but do appear in the Review Queue. Any Deferred record in the Review Queue can be set to a final status of Unconfirmed or Accepted at any point. 

**How do I keep Deferred records for more than 14 days?** Any record, including Deferred records, can be kept in your queue for longer than 14 days by setting the decision to Unconfirm using the reason Species-Rereview Requested. This will change the status to Rereview and keep the record in the Review Queue indefinitely. Note that there is usually no reason to do this, as Unconfirmed records will reappear in the queue when media or notes are added by the observer. 

**How are Deferred records are displayed in eBird?** Deferred records do not appear in public eBird data (maps, graphs, etc.) but will continue to appear with the Unconfirmed tag on eBird Alerts (if within the 7-day window of the Alerts). This can be useful so that area birders are alerted to a possible rarity and can assist in providing documentation. 

**How are Deferred records displayed in Review Tools?** When a record is set to Deferred each action is recorded in the record’s History on the [observation page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gmi74SDISCWFA1CJbfjHqtc4yLOPHlWg9LolSBdFNI0/edit#heading=h.bbsadu82dv02). Using the Defer option from Quick Review will set two records at the same time: one for the default email being sent and one for the preliminary decision. In the below example, once the 14-day window expires, another History line will be added that sets the record to Unconfirmed with the reason Documentation Inadequate-Species.
